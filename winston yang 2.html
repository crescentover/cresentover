    <h1>San Francisco: the best and the worst</h1>
    
    <h2><strong>Stonestown</strong> is my favoraite place </h2>
    
    <p>I love that place because i can shop with my friend there. Unlike downtown, there is no homelessness.</p>
    
    <h2>i dislike <em>Chinatown</em></h2>
    
    <p>I dont like that place becuase the road there is so narrow, and chinese people at that place is rude and annoy.</p>
